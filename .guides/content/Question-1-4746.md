### Create a function that returns 1 if leap year and 0 if not. 
 * The function name must be:  isLeapYr  which returns an int and has a int parameter for the year
 * Your main method must use your isLeapYr function to determine if the year the user entered is a leap year. 
 * Ask the user to enter a year atleast one time inform the user whether the year is a leap year then ask if they would like to continue such that 1 continues 0 quits. If they choose to continue ask them to enter another year.
 
Note:  a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 400, or if is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100.
 * Example leap years: 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024, 2028, 2032, 2036, 2040, 2044, and 2048.
